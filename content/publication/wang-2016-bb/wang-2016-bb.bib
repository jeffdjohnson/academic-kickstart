 abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to
investigate whether age-related differences in episodic memory
performance are accompanied by a reduction in the specificity of
recollected information. We addressed this question by comparing
recollection-related cortical reinstatement in young and older
adults. At study, subjects viewed objects and concrete words,
making 1 of 2 different semantic judgments depending on the study
material. Test items were words that corresponded to studied
words or the names of studied objects. Subjects indicated whether
each test item was recollected, familiar, or novel. Reinstatement
of information differentiating the encoding tasks was quantified
both with a univariate analysis of the fMRI signal and with a
multivoxel pattern analysis, using a classifier that had been
trained to discriminate between the 2 classes of study episode.
The results of these analyses converged to suggest that
reinstatement did not differ according to age. Thus, there was no
evidence that specificity of recollected information was reduced
in older individuals. Additionally, there were no age effects in
the magnitude of recollection-related modulations in regional
activity or in the neural correlates of post-retrieval
monitoring. Taken together, the findings suggest that the neural
mechanisms engaged during successful episodic retrieval can
remain stable with advancing age.},
