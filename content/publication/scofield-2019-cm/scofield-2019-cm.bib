 abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of subjects with ADHD typically show altered
functional connectivity in prefrontal, striatal, and several
temporal brain regions. While the majority of studies have
focused on connectivity that is averaged over time, we
investigated the temporal dynamics of brain network changes in
resting-state fMRI. Using the ADHD-200 consortium, we
characterized the time course of latent state changes using
Hidden Markov Modeling, and compared state changes between boys
and girls with ADHD along with typically developing controls. Sex
differences were found in latent state switching, with boys
dwelling longer in a given state than girls, and concurrently
having fewer overall state transitions. These sex differences
were found in children with ADHD and in typically developing
controls. Children with ADHD were also found to be more variable
in terms of state transitions than controls. These findings add
to the growing literature on neural sex differences and may be
related to the sex difference in focal versus diffuse attention.},
