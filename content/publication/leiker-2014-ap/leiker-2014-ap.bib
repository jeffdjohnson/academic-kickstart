 abstract = {Recent functional neuroimaging studies have attempted to
understand the cognitive and neural bases of episodic memory
retrieval, as well as the extent to which different retrieval
judgments reflect qualitative as opposed to continuous changes in
neural signals. The present study addressed this issue by
investigating the reinstatement of episodic content according to
the amount of information available at retrieval. Subjects
encoded a series of words in the context of three distinct tasks,
while a manipulation of presentation duration (4 or 8s) was also
employed. A later recognition memory test was used to segregate
trials according to whether or not they were accompanied by the
recollection of details from encoding. Functional MRI data
acquired during both the encoding and retrieval phases were used
in conjunction with multi-voxel pattern-analysis (MVPA) to
provide a measure of the degree to which encoding-related
patterns of brain activity were later reactivated (reinstated) at
the time of retrieval. Critically, the magnitude of reinstatement
differed with respect to the encoding manipulation, such that
reinstatement was stronger for items associated with the longer
presentation duration. Together with duration-related differences
in retrieval activity in left posterior parietal cortex, the
results provide neural evidence for the reinstatement of
different amounts of episodic information, consistent with the
idea that recollection is based on a continuous neural signal.},
