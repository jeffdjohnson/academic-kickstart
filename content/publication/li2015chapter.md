abstract: "This article is a summary of attention and memory as well as their interactions in the context of brain imaging research performed in the last two decades. Attention is introduced under a three-component framework which divides attention into three distinct components: alerting, orienting, and executive control. Memory is introduced under the three-component model: sensory memory, short-term or working memory (WM), and long-term memory (LTM). Emphasis is put on the components showing the closest interactions, such as interactions between orienting and executive control in the area of attention and between WM and LTM."
