 abstract = {The neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval
(``recollection'') differ according to the type of information
contained in the recollected episode. Such content-specific
recollection effects have been hypothesized to reflect the
reinstatement of processes or representations active during
encoding. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance
imaging, we evaluated this hypothesis by directly contrasting the
neural activity elicited during the encoding and subsequent
recollection of words studied with one of 2 encoding tasks. Study
words appearing on pictures of scenes required imagining the
word's referent at any location within the scene, whereas words
appearing on a blank background required generating a sentence
that incorporated the word. On a later memory test, the neural
correlates of recollection were operationalized by contrasting
the activity elicited during correct ``remember'' versus ``know''
responses. Recollected words from the ``scene'' task elicited
activity in regions of left occipital cortex and anterior
fusiform gyrus that overlapped regions where encoding-related
activity was greater for the scene than sentence task.
Conversely, activity elicited by words recollected from the
``sentence'' task overlapped with a region of ventromedial
frontal cortex where encoding-related activity was greater for
the sentence task. These content-specific associations between
encoding- and recollection-related neural activity strongly
support the reinstatement hypothesis of episodic retrieval.},
