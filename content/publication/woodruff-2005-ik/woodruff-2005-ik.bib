 abstract = {It is widely assumed that episodic retrieval (recollection)
involves reinstatement of cortical activity engaged during the
processing of an episode when it was initially experienced. It
follows from this assumption that the cortical correlates of
recollection should differ with the content of what is
recollected, and that retrieval of different content should be
associated with activity in functionally distinct cortical
regions. The present experiment investigated these predictions.
Subjects (N=17) studied a mixed list of words and pictures and
were then presented with a test list comprised of words only.
Test items were studied words, the names of studied pictures, and
unstudied (new) words. Functional magnetic resonance images were
acquired while the subjects made Remember/Know/New judgments to
these test words. Independent of study material, studied items
endorsed as Remembered elicited greater activity than correctly
classified unstudied items in several regions, including left
frontal, left lateral parietal, and posterior cingulate cortex.
In addition, Remembered items elicited greater activity in the
right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus than items accorded
Know judgments, replicating previous findings. Analysis of
content-specific effects demonstrated a regional
double-dissociation within left fusiform cortex; recollected
words elicited greater activity than recollected pictures in
lateral fusiform, whereas the reverse effect was evident in an
anterior fusiform region. The lateral and anterior fusiform areas
correspond closely to areas held to be functionally specialized
for the processing of visual words and pictures, respectively.
Thus, the current findings support the cortical reinstatement
hypothesis of episodic retrieval.},
