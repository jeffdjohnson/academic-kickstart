 abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of episodic memory have consistently
demonstrated that memory retrieval involves reactivating patterns
of neural activity that were present during encoding, and these
effects are thought to reflect the qualitative retrieval
(recollection) of information that is specific to the content of
an episode. By contrast, recollection is also accompanied by
other neural correlates that generalize across episodic content
and are consequently referred to as the ``core recollection
network''. The neural mechanism by which these specific and core
effects interact to give rise to episodic memory retrieval is
largely unknown. The current study addressed this issue by
testing for correlations (connectivity) between pattern
reactivation and activity in the core recollection network.
Subjects encoded a series of words with different tasks and then
completed a two-step source memory test, whereby they identified
the task (source) previously associated with the word and the
confidence of that judgment. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)
was used in combination with fMRI to first identify
encoding-related neural patterns and then test for their
reactivation during retrieval. Consistent with prior findings,
the magnitude of reactivation increased with source-memory
confidence. Moreover, individual-trial measures of reactivation
exhibited positive correlations with activity in multiple regions
of the core recollection network. Importantly, evidence of
functional connectivity between pattern reactivation and a region
of left posterior parietal cortex supports the role of this
region in tracking the retrieval of episodic information in
service of making subjective memory decisions.},
