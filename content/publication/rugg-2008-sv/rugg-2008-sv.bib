 abstract = {The principle of transfer-appropriate processing and the cortical
reinstatement hypothesis are two influential theoretical
frameworks, articulated at the psychological and neurobiological
levels of explanation, respectively, that each propose that the
processes supporting the encoding and retrieval of episodic
information are strongly interdependent. Here, we integrate these
two frameworks into a single model that generates predictions
that can be tested using functional neuroimaging methods in
healthy humans, and then go on to describe findings that are in
accord with these predictions. Consistent with the
transfer-appropriate processing and cortical reinstatement
frameworks, the neural correlates of successful encoding vary
according to how retrieval is cued, and the neural correlates of
retrieval are modulated by how items are encoded. Thus, encoding
and retrieval should not be viewed as separate stages of memory
that can be investigated in isolation from one another.},
