  abstract = "It is widely assumed that episodic retrieval (recollection)
              involves reinstatement of cortical activity engaged during the
              processing of an episode when it was initially experienced. It
              follows from this assumption that the cortical correlates of
              recollection should differ with the content of what is
              recollected, and that retrieval of different content should be
              associated with activity in functionally distinct cortical
              regions. The present experiment investigated these predictions.
              Subjects (N=17) studied a mixed list of words and pictures and
              were then presented with a test list comprised of words only.
              Test items were studied words, the names of studied pictures, and
              unstudied (new) words. Functional magnetic resonance images were
              acquired while the subjects made Remember/Know/New judgments to
              these test words. Independent of study material, studied items
              endorsed as Remembered elicited greater activity than correctly
              classified unstudied items in several regions, including left
              frontal, left lateral parietal, and posterior cingulate cortex.
              In addition, Remembered items elicited greater activity in the
              right hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus than items accorded
              Know judgments, replicating previous findings. Analysis of
              content-specific effects demonstrated a regional
              double-dissociation within left fusiform cortex; recollected
              words elicited greater activity than recollected pictures in
              lateral fusiform, whereas the reverse effect was evident in an
              anterior fusiform region. The lateral and anterior fusiform areas
              correspond closely to areas held to be functionally specialized
              for the processing of visual words and pictures, respectively.
              Thus, the current findings support the cortical reinstatement
              hypothesis of episodic retrieval.",

  abstract = "For over a century, memory researchers have extensively studied
              the differences between retrieving memories that were encoded in
              the remote past as opposed to recently. Although this work has
              largely focused on the changes that these memory traces undergo
              over time, an unexplored issue is whether retrieval attempts and
              other strategic processes might be differentially oriented in
              order to effectively access memories of different ages. The
              current study addressed this issue by instructing participants to
              retrieve words that were encoded either one week (remote) or
              about 30 minutes earlier (recent). To maximize the possibility
              that participants adopted distinct retrieval orientations,
              separate blocks of the memory test employed exclusion task
              procedures in which the words from only one encoding period were
              targeted at a given time, in the face of distractors from the

              confounding effects of retrieval success. The new-item ERPs
              revealed differences according to the targeted week, such that
              the ERPs over posterior scalp were more positive-going for the

              The present study contrasted the ERP correlates of incidental
              emotional retrieval as a function of study-test delay. Pictures
              of emotionally neutral objects were encoded in association with
              either emotionally negative or emotionally neutral scenes. In a

              After the short delay, ERPs elicited by objects paired with

              employed. A later recognition memory test was used to segregate

              remains unclear, however, whether these effects directly reflect

              series of words that were each presented in the context of one of
              two encoding tasks. One task required the covert generation of a

              details are recollected. We used multivoxel

              particularly those accompanied by recollection versus a feeling

              trained to distinguish between brain activity patterns associated

              recognition-related fMRI data to determine the degree to which

              a correlate of post-retrieval processing. In two experiments we
              examined whether the right frontal effect is specifically
              associated with processing of the products of an episodic
              retrieval attempt. During study, subjects in both experiments

              source memory task, in which subjects responded 'new' to
              unstudied pictures and signaled the semantic judgment made on
              each studied picture. A separate study phase was followed by a
              task in which the studied items required a judgment about their
              semantic attributes. Robust right frontal effects were elicited
              by old items in both tasks, indicating that the effects are not
              selective for the monitoring of the content of information
              retrieved from episodic memory. In experiment 2, separate study
              phases were followed by test phases where semantic judgments were
              made either on old items (as in experiment 1), or on new items.
              Right frontal effects were elicited by whichever class of items,
              old or new, required the semantic judgment. Together, these

  abstract = "Neuroimaging studies of episodic memory have consistently
              demonstrated that memory retrieval involves reactivating patterns
              of neural activity that were present during encoding, and these
              effects are thought to reflect the qualitative retrieval
              (recollection) of information that is specific to the content of
              an episode. By contrast, recollection is also accompanied by
              other neural correlates that generalize across episodic content
              and are consequently referred to as the ``core recollection
              network''. The neural mechanism by which these specific and core
              effects interact to give rise to episodic memory retrieval is
              largely unknown. The current study addressed this issue by
              testing for correlations (connectivity) between pattern
              reactivation and activity in the core recollection network.
              Subjects encoded a series of words with different tasks and then
              completed a two-step source memory test, whereby they identified
              the task (source) previously associated with the word and the
              confidence of that judgment. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)
              was used in combination with fMRI to first identify
              encoding-related neural patterns and then test for their
              reactivation during retrieval. Consistent with prior findings,
              the magnitude of reactivation increased with source-memory
              confidence. Moreover, individual-trial measures of reactivation
              exhibited positive correlations with activity in multiple regions
              of the core recollection network. Importantly, evidence of
              functional connectivity between pattern reactivation and a region
              of left posterior parietal cortex supports the role of this
              region in tracking the retrieval of episodic information in

              imaging, we evaluated this hypothesis by directly contrasting the

              recollection of words studied with one of 2 encoding tasks. Study
              words appearing on pictures of scenes required imagining the

              appearing on a blank background required generating a sentence
              that incorporated the word. On a later memory test, the neural
              correlates of recollection were operationalized by contrasting
              the activity elicited during correct ``remember'' versus ``know''

              activity in regions of left occipital cortex and anterior
