 abstract = {Dual-process models of recognition memory distinguish between the
retrieval of qualitative information about a prior event
(recollection), and judgments of prior occurrence based on an
acontextual sense of familiarity. fMRI studies investigating the
neural correlates of memory encoding and retrieval conducted
within the dual-process framework have frequently reported
findings consistent with the view that the hippocampus
selectively supports recollection, and has little or no role in
familiarity-based recognition. An alternative interpretation of
these findings has been proposed, however, in which it is argued
that the hippocampus supports the encoding and retrieval of
'strong' memories, regardless of whether the memories are
recollection- or familiarity-based. Here, we describe the
findings of eight fMRI studies from our laboratory: one study of
source memory encoding, four studies of the retrieval of
contextual information, and three studies of continuous
recognition. Together, the findings support the proposal that
hippocampal activity co-varies with the amount of contextual
information about a study episode that is encoded or retrieved,
and not with the strength of an undifferentiated memory signal.},
