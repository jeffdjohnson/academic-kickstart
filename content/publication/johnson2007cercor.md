title: "Recollection and the reinstatement of encoding-related cortical activity"
doi: 
date: 2007-11-01

abstract: "The neural correlates of episodic memory retrieval (``recollection'') differ according to the type of information contained in the recollected episode. Such content-specific recollection effects have been hypothesized to reflect the reinstatement of processes or representations active during encoding. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we evaluated this hypothesis by directly contrasting the neural activity elicited during the encoding and subsequent recollection of words studied with one of 2 encoding tasks. Study words appearing on pictures of scenes required imagining the word's referent at any location within the scene, whereas words appearing on a blank background required generating a sentence that incorporated the word. On a later memory test, the neural correlates of recollection were operationalized by contrasting the activity elicited during correct ``remember'' versus ``know'' responses. Recollected words from the ``scene'' task elicited activity in regions of left occipital cortex and anterior fusiform gyrus that overlapped regions where encoding-related activity was greater for the scene than sentence task. Conversely, activity elicited by words recollected from the ``sentence'' task overlapped with a region of ventromedial frontal cortex where encoding-related activity was greater for the sentence task. These content-specific associations between encoding- and recollection-related neural activity strongly support the reinstatement hypothesis of episodic retrieval."
