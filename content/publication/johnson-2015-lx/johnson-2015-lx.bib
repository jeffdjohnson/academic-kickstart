 abstract = {Several fMRI studies have shown a correspondence between the
brain regions activated during encoding and retrieval, consistent
with the view that memory retrieval involves
hippocampally-mediated reinstatement of cortical activity. With
the limited temporal resolution of fMRI, the precise timing of
such reactivation is unclear, calling into question the
functional significance of these effects. Whereas reactivation
influencing retrieval should emerge with neural correlates of
retrieval success, that signifying post-retrieval monitoring
would trail retrieval. The present study employed EEG to provide
a temporal landmark of retrieval success from which we could
investigate the sub-trial time course of reactivation.
Pattern-classification analyses revealed that early-onsetting
reactivation differentiated the outcome of recognition-memory
judgments and was associated with individual differences in
behavioral accuracy, while reactivation was also evident in a
sustained form later in the trial. The EEG findings suggest that,
whereas prior fMRI findings could be interpreted as reflecting
the contribution of reinstatement to retrieval success, they
could also indicate the maintenance of episodic information in
service of post-retrieval evaluation.},
