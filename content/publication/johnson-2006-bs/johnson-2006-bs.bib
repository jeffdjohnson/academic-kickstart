 abstract = {Retrieval orientation refers to the differential processing of
retrieval cues according to the type of information sought from
memory (e.g., words vs. pictures). In the present study,
event-related potentials (ERPs) were employed to investigate
whether the neural correlates of differential retrieval
orientations are sensitive to the specificity of the retrieval
demands of the test task. In separate study-test phases, subjects
encoded lists of intermixed words and pictures, and then
undertook one of two retrieval tests, in both of which the
retrieval cues were exclusively words. In the recognition test,
subjects performed 'old/new' discriminations on the test items,
and old items corresponded to only one class of studied material
(words or pictures). In the exclusion test, old items
corresponded to both classes of study material, and subjects were
required to respond 'old' only to test items corresponding to a
designated class of material. Thus, demands for retrieval
specificity were greater in the exclusion test than during
recognition. ERPs elicited by correctly classified new items in
the two types of test were contrasted according to whether words
or pictures were the sought-for material. Material-dependent ERP
effects were evident in both tests, but the effects onset earlier
and offset later in the exclusion test. The findings suggest that
differential processing of retrieval cues, and hence the adoption
of differential retrieval orientations, varies according to the
specificity of the retrieval goal.},
