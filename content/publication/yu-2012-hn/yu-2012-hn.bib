 abstract = {It has been proposed that the hippocampus selectively supports
retrieval of contextual associations, but an alternative view
holds that the hippocampus supports strong memories regardless of
whether they contain contextual information. We employed a memory
test that combined the 'Remember/Know' and source memory
procedures, which allowed test items to be segregated both by
memory strength (recognition accuracy) and, separately, by the
quality of the contextual information that could be retrieved
(indexed by the accuracy/confidence of a source memory judgment).
As measured by fMRI, retrieval-related hippocampal activity
tracked the quality of retrieved contextual information and not
memory strength. These findings are consistent with the proposal
that the hippocampus supports contextual recollection rather than
recognition memory more generally.},
