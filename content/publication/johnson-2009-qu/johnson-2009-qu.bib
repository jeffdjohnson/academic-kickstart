 abstract = {Episodic memory retrieval is thought to involve reinstatement of
the neurocognitive processes engaged when an episode was encoded.
Prior fMRI studies and computational models have suggested that
reinstatement is limited to instances in which specific episodic
details are recollected. We used multivoxel
pattern-classification analyses of fMRI data to investigate how
reinstatement is associated with different memory judgments,
particularly those accompanied by recollection versus a feeling
of familiarity (when recollection is absent). Classifiers were
trained to distinguish between brain activity patterns associated
with different encoding tasks and were subsequently applied to
recognition-related fMRI data to determine the degree to which
patterns were reinstated. Reinstatement was evident during both
recollection- and familiarity-based judgments, providing clear
evidence that reinstatement is not sufficient for eliciting a
recollective experience. The findings are interpreted as support
for a continuous, recollection-related neural signal that has
been central to recent debate over the nature of recognition
memory processes.},
