 abstract = {Studies employing event-related potentials (ERPs) during tests of
recognition memory have reported differences in neural activity
elicited by new test items according to the specific demands of
the retrieval task, such as retrieving studied words versus
pictures. The present study investigated whether differential
processing of new items is possible when retrieval demands vary
unpredictably on a trial-by-trial basis. In separate study-test
phases, subjects encoded lists of intermixed words and pictures,
and undertook retrieval tests with words as test items. Each test
item was preceded by a task cue that signaled whether subjects
were to attempt to retrieve a word or a picture from the study
list. In the ``blocked''condition, the targeted study material
remained constant throughout the test, whereas in the
``mixed''condition, the targeted material varied unpredictably
across trials. New-item ERPs were more positive-going when words
rather than pictures were targeted in the ``blocked'' condition,
replicating previous findings, but this effect was absent in the
``mixed''condition. The findings are consistent with the
hypothesis that differential processing of retrieval cues depends
upon the adoption of different task sets (``retrieval
orientations'' that develop over multiple trials and cannot be
adjusted merely in response to an instructional cue. Unlike the
new-item ERPs, ERPs elicited by the task cues in the mixed
condition differed according to targeted material, but only on
trials when there was a switch between target material. The
implications of these findings for understanding the different
retrieval strategies engaged when retrieval demands are
consistent versus inconsistent are discussed.},
