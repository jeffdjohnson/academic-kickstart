Our lab studies the cognitive and brain underpinnings of *episodic memory* - a type of memory that allows people to encode and remember the events of their daily lives. We combine methods from experimental psychology with neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). Our approach of investigating normal neurocognitive function in healthy young adults has the ultimate goal of understanding how memory is impaired by brain injury, developmental disorders, neurological disease, and natural aging.

If you're interested in training in the lab, the Department of Psychological Sciences at the University of Missouri has a [PhD program](https://psychology.missouri.edu/grad/graduate-program) in Cognition and Neuroscience, and we also occasionally have opportunities for [undergraduate research](https://psychology.missouri.edu/undergrad/research). Contact Jeff Johnson (<jeffreyjohnson@missouri.edu>) to discuss these opportunities.
